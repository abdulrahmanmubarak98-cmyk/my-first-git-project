# My First Git Project

This repository documents my journey learning Git and Github.
I remember making my first commit and honestly all i could think was i need to be consistent to achieve what i want. Started this journey confused not certain what the future holds but one thing was certain i was not going to give up no matter what. look at me today no longer a beginner, no longer confused just steady grind and believing in myself. I believe my repos speak for themselves. Whatever a man desire he can achieve.
